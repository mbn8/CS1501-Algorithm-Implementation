This project uses a hash function that considers the first two letters and last letter of each word from a list of 10,000 words, 
and each word's associated frequency of usage in books.
It implements a hash map with linked list chaining to map 10,000 words to their associated frequencies.
The project also tests the sparsity of the link list chaining.
